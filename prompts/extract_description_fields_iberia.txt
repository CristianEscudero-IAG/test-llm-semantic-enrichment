PROCESSING RULES:
1. For taskcards: extract the code after 'TASKCARD'
2. For work orders: extract the code after 'WO'
3. For actions: set true if ANY mention appears in description
4. For revisions: extract ONLY when explicit 'REV' appears
5. For part numbers: capture alphanumeric sequences after P/N. Ex: P/NG2557685700000AMM -> G2557685700000 and append all part_numbers to the same key 'part_numbers'.
6. Maintain original description order in output keys

INPUT DESCRIPTIONS:
{descriptions}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, code blocks, or extra text)
2. JSON object must use description numbers as keys ("1", "2", etc)
3. Ensure output is directly loadable with json.loads()
4. Do NOT include ```json or explanatory text
5. Maintain exact key names and structure from example
