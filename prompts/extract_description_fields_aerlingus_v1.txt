You are an expert in aircraft maintenance data extraction. Extract the following standardized fields from each maintenance description provided. 

FIELD IDENTIFICATION GUIDANCE:
{{
  "reference": "Look for AMM, SB, R330, procedure codes, or any technical reference",
  "part_number": "Look for P/N, PN:, part number patterns (alphanumeric with dashes/letters)",
  "serial_number": "Look for S/N, SN:, serial number patterns (alphanumeric)",
  "component": "Any aircraft component, system, or part mentioned",
  "position": "Aircraft position codes, engine numbers, wing locations, or any position reference",
  "maintenance_type": "INSPECTION, SERVICING, REPLACEMENT, REPAIR, FINDING, or any maintenance action",
  "taskcard": "Look for TASKCARD followed by any code format (ALT-, ZL-, numeric, etc.)",
  "finding": "Look for finding identifiers (NRC, finding numbers, defect codes, etc.)",
  "action": "Any action described (performed, found, inspected, replaced, etc.)",
  "personnel": "Names, signatures, or personnel codes mentioned",
  "corrective_action": "Actions taken to fix issues or defects"
}}

EXTRACTION EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
Text: ENGINE STARTER PERFORM ON PN:3505468-6 SN:GRTA0635 SERVICING (STARTER-801100-G1-1- OIL CHANGE)
Extracted: {{
  "maintenance_type": "SERVICING",
  "component": "ENGINE STARTER",
  "part_number": "3505468-6",
  "serial_number": "GRTA0635",
  "action": "OIL CHANGE",
  "reference": "STARTER-801100-G1-1"
}}

Example 2:
Text: FINDING (NRC) TASKCARD ZL-531-01-1 (04) / ITEM 1 NRC N°105019 RH WING DENT FOUND DURING INSPECTION
Extracted: {{
  "maintenance_type": "FINDING",
  "component": "RH WING",
  "finding": "NRC N°105019",
  "taskcard": "ZL-531-01-1",
  "position": "RH WING",
  "action": "DENT FOUND DURING INSPECTION",
  "finding_related": true,
  "failure_description": "DENT FOUND"
}}

Example 3:
Text: THRUST RV 33F-FIRESHIELD/SEALS-GVI-INSPECTION FLAP TRACK FAIRING N°4 GALMAR
Extracted: {{
  "maintenance_type": "INSPECTION",
  "component": "FLAP TRACK FAIRING",
  "position": "N°4",
  "action": "FIRESHIELD/SEALS INSPECTION",
  "reference": "THRUST RV 33F-FIRESHIELD/SEALS-GVI",
  "personnel": "GALMAR"
}}

CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract EXACTLY what appears in the text, never use example values
- Be flexible with formats - adapt to what you see in the actual text
- For taskcard: Extract any code that follows "TASKCARD" regardless of format
- For finding: Extract any finding identifier, number, or code mentioned
- For component: Extract any aircraft part, system, or component mentioned
- For personnel: Extract names, signatures, or codes at the end of descriptions
- For position: Extract any location reference (wing, engine, numbered positions)
- If a field cannot be found in the text, set it to null
- Do not assume or infer values - only extract what is explicitly written
- Boolean fields (finding_related) should be true if "FINDING" appears anywhere in text
- Maintain original formatting and capitalization for all extracted values
- Look for variations in field formats (P/N vs PN:, S/N vs SN:, etc.)

REQUIRED FIELDS (must be extracted for every description):
- description_id: Unique identifier for the maintenance description
