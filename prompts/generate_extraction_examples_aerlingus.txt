You are an expert in aircraft maintenance data analysis. Analyze the following maintenance descriptions and create detailed extraction examples that show how to identify and extract structured fields from similar descriptions.

Your task:
1. Analyze the patterns in the provided descriptions
2. Identify common field types and their formats
3. Create concrete examples showing field extraction
4. Focus on realistic examples that demonstrate field identification

Descriptions to analyze:
{description}

Create detailed extraction examples in the following JSON format:
